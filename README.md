# Awesome SQL alternatives

## Relational databases

Non-SQL query languages which operate on a relational database.

### [Logica](https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica) (BigQuery, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
> Logica is a logic programming language that compiles to StandardSQL.

### [Malloy](https://github.com/looker-open-source/malloy) (BigQuery)
> Malloy is an experimental language for describing data relationships and transformations. Akin to a SQL “extension,” it is far easier to use and reason about than SQL, it is usable in place of SQL, and it is quick to pick up for SQL users.

### [openCypher](https://github.com/bitnine-oss/agensgraph) (PostgreSQL)
> [openCypher](http://opencypher.org/) is the most widely adopted, fully-specified, and open query language for property graph databases. ANSI-SQL queries and Cypher queries can be integrated into a single query in [AgensGraph](https://bitnine.net/agensgraph/).

### [Rel](https://docs.relational.ai/rel/intro/overview/) (RelationalAI)

> Rel is an expressive, declarative, and relational language designed for modeling domain knowledge.

## Poly-store
Query languages which operate on both relational and non-relational data

### [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/tutorial.html) (AWS various, others)
> PartiQL’s extensions to SQL are easy to understand, treat nested data as first class citizens and compose seamlessly with each other and SQL. This enables intuitive filtering, joining and aggregation on the combination of structured, semistructured and nested datasets.

## Educational

### [Tutorial D](https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Rel) (Rel)
> Rel is a desktop database management system that implements Date & Darwen's "Tutorial D" database language.

### [Datalog Educational System](http://des.sourceforge.net/)
> The Datalog Educational System is a deductive database system with Datalog, SQL, Relational Algebra, Tuple Relational Calculus and Domain Relational Calculus as query languages. 

## Relational operators in non-relational databases

### [Optic API](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/OpticAPI) (Marklogic)
> The MarkLogic Optic API makes it possible to perform relational operations on indexed values and documents.
