# Awesome SQL alternatives
A list of non-SQL data languages which run on relational databases.

## Open-source

### [Logica](https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica) (BigQuery, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
> Logica is a logic programming language that compiles to StandardSQL.

### [Malloy](https://github.com/looker-open-source/malloy) (BigQuery)
> Malloy is an experimental language for describing data relationships and transformations. Akin to a SQL “extension,” it is far easier to use and reason about than SQL, it is usable in place of SQL, and it is quick to pick up for SQL users.

### [openCypher](https://github.com/bitnine-oss/agensgraph) (PostgreSQL)
> [openCypher](http://opencypher.org/) is the most widely adopted, fully-specified, and open query language for property graph databases. ANSI-SQL queries and Cypher queries can be integrated into a single query in [AgensGraph](https://bitnine.net/agensgraph/).

## Commercial

### [Rel](https://docs.relational.ai/rel/intro/overview/) (RelationalAI)

> Rel is an expressive, declarative, and relational language designed for modeling domain knowledge.

## Educational

### [Tutorial D](https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Rel) (Rel)
> Rel is a desktop database management system that implements Date & Darwen's "Tutorial D" database language.

### [Datalog Educational System](http://des.sourceforge.net/)
> The Datalog Educational System is a deductive database system with Datalog, SQL, Relational Algebra, Tuple Relational Calculus and Domain Relational Calculus as query languages. 

## Multi-model databases
Relational operators in non-relational databases.

### [Optic API](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/OpticAPI) (Marklogic)
> The MarkLogic Optic API makes it possible to perform relational operations on indexed values and documents.
